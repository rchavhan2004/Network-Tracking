  <strong>📡 A Comprehensive Tool for Monitoring and Analyzing Network Traffic</strong>
</p>

---

## ⚡ Overview

The **Network Tracking Tool** is a robust Python-based project aimed at tracking and analyzing network activity. It helps you monitor, log, and analyze traffic across various devices connected to your network, providing detailed insights into the data flow.

> **🔍 Why Network Tracking?**
> - Gain visibility into network traffic.
> - Diagnose connectivity issues.
> - Ensure better network security.

---

## 🛠 Features

- 📊 **Real-time network monitoring**
- 🔍 **Packet inspection** for detailed analysis
- 🌐 **Protocol identification** (HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc.)
- 📝 **Traffic logging** for later review
- 🚀 **Cross-platform support** (Linux, Windows, MacOS)

---

## 🧩 How It Works

### 🌐 Real-time Monitoring
- Captures packets traveling through your network interface.

### 🛡 Protocol Analysis
- Identifies network protocols such as HTTP, TCP, UDP, and more.

### 📁 Traffic Logging
- Logs the captured packets for post-analysis and debugging.

<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">Follow these steps to trace network traffic and visualize locations securely:</p>

<ol style="line-height: 1.8;">
  <li><strong style="color: #2196F3;">🔧 Setup</strong> - Install Wireshark and prepare it for capturing network packets on your device.</li>
  <li><strong style="color: #2196F3;">🌐 Capture Network Traffic</strong> - Use Wireshark to monitor live network traffic on your selected interface.</li>
  <li><strong style="color: #2196F3;">📊 Packet Analysis</strong> - Filter and decode packets to retrieve useful information, such as IP addresses and communication protocols.</li>
  <li><strong style="color: #2196F3;">🌍 Google Maps Integration</strong> - Use Python scripts to connect with the Google Maps API and prepare the data for mapping.</li>
  <li><strong style="color: #2196F3;">🗺️ Visualize Data</strong> - Plot geographic locations based on IP addresses on a dynamic Google Map.</li>
  <li><strong style="color: #2196F3;">🔍 Security Monitoring</strong> - Analyze the network traffic for signs of unusual behavior or security threats.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Your network’s security, now on the map! 🌍</p>
